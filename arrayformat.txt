Here's how I would like the array formatted

[0]: Type of request (add/edit/delete)
[1]: What you're adding to/deleting from/editing (Calendar section or notes section)

From here on I'm going to split it by type for readability
----------------
Add

[2]: username
[3]: Body of text
[4]: Date (If it's a calendar add) otherwise nothing
----------------------------------------

Edit
[2]: ID of what's being edited (this will be provided when page is loaded init.)
[3]: What field is being updated
[4]: The new text/date

------------------------------------------
Delete
[2]: ID of what's being deleted (provided on page load)
